Formal Trust Architecture For Assuring Trusted Interactions In the Internet of Things
The Internet of Things (IoT) has provided a flexible
platform for a large number of heterogeneous devices to
dynamically join and leave the network. This enhances the
availability of a diverse range of services provided by a network.
However, this dynamic expansion of the network with mobile
IoT devices introduces a major challenge to security especially
related to management of trust across the diverse IoT platforms.
Thus arises the necessity for a mechanism that can ensure the
selection of secure and trusted devices as these devices try to
join the network. In this work, an effective formal approach
to trust modeling mechanism has been investigated to support
dynamic trust development between devices based on two-tier
trust architecture.
